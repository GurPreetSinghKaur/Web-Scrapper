# Web-Scrapper
A price comparison website which displays Apple smartphones and their different prices.
it facilitates the process of looking for the best price when purchasing an iPhone. This is done by first scraping data from 5 different e-commerce websites, then storing the data in the database and finally displaying it to the user through the web application.



Web scraping consists of 5 Java threads, with each thread being a website. When the Java
application is run, the threads start simultaneously and are put to sleep after they finish
scraping. The application can be stopped by typing “q” in the console.
